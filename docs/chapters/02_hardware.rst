The encoder features a 12-bit and 14-bit resolution, both single-turn and multi-turn. These level of resolutions enables precise position feedback for a variety of motion control systems.

In terms of communication, the AMT21 encoder uses an RS485 interface, which is a differential serial communication protocol that allows for long-distance communication and noise immunity. The encoder also features a configurable baud rate of up to 2 Mbps, allowing for fast and reliable data transmission.

Overall, the AMT21 absolute encoder from CUI devices is a reliable and high-precision sensor that offers a range of advanced features, including a robust design, high accuracy and resolution, and fast and reliable communication via its RS485 interface.
