      The AMT21 is a compact and robust absolute encoder that provides high accuracy and resolution, making it suitable for a wide range of industrial applications. It uses a non-contact magnetic sensing technology, which ensures high reliability and durability in harsh environments.

      The encoder features a 12-bit and 14-bit resolution, both single-turn multi-turn. These level of resolutions enables precise position feedback for a variety of motion control systems.

      In terms of communication, the AMT21 encoder uses an RS485 interface, which is a differential serial communication protocol that allows for long-distance communication and noise immunity. The encoder also features a configurable baud rate of up to 2 Mbps, allowing for fast and reliable data transmission.

      Overall, the AMT21 absolute encoder from CUI devices is a reliable and high-precision sensor that offers a range of advanced features, including a robust design, high accuracy and resolution, and fast and reliable communication via its RS485 interface.
